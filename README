Turnsole is a curses client for Heliotrope, the personal email server. Much
of its code is based on / stolen from Sup (http://sup.rubyforge.org).

Turnsole is still under development; as such, there is no gem yet. You will
have to run it the hard way:

0. Install Heliotrope. See the README at http://github.com/wmorgan/heliotrope.
1. Start Heliotrope.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/wmorgan/turnsole.git`.
3. Run `ruby -Ilib bin/turnsole`.
